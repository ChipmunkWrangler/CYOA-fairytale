Bob bounds through the forest like a deer. Alice lights her way. Soon, they hear the river burbling. They step out from under the trees. Moonlight strikes sparks on the rushing water. Within a ring of mushrooms, a swarm of fairies glitters and whirls. "Swing your partner, stroll up the middle.  Dip and spin and quiver to the tune.  Elf owls toot while the crickets fiddle.  Dance the river, sing the moon!"     The fairies cheer as Bob leaps into the ring. They skip and stomp and twirl together. Bob feels light, as if she could jump to the sky. The moon rises higher. The music gets faster. Finally, Bob and the fairy dancers collapse, dizzy and delighted.
"Is that a kind of bush?" "No!" "Ok! Hey, do you like to dance? My friends are having a party by the river. Do you want to come?"
"Sure!"
Bob wakes up. She isn't in her bed. She isn't even in her room. She isn't at home at all. She is in a midnight forest. Bob thinks "I need help!"
"I should hide!"
"Wow! I'm going to explore!"
She climbs a huge oak tree. Quiet as an owl, she watches and waits. Darkness. Silence. Until the bushes rustle. A branch snaps.  Something is coming.  Something big. Something that grunts and pants and squeals as it comes.   It stops right under Bob's tree. It stares up at her with huge round eyes. It speaks!   "I see you, little girl. You look delicious. I'm going to pull this tree up by the roots and shake you out like a ripe apple."  But wait -- What is this?
"Dad?"   Darkness.  "Mom?"  Silence.   Bob is all alone.  But wait -- what's this?
She creeps through the silence. A dot of green light floats past her eyes. It vanishes, then reappears. Another joins it, and another. Fireflies! A swarm circles Bob. It draws her onward, past endless trees. All the lights wink out at once.  Darkness. No! Bob can just make out a silver glow ahead. She strides towards it. A log cabin, bleached by moonlight!
"Hurg!". The thing strains. The oak tree tilts. "Ew!" "You look tasty, too, fairy." "I can get us out of here, but you have to close your eyes, ok?" "Rrrrraunh!" The oak is toppling....
A light bobs among the treetops. As it floats closer, Bob sees that it is a glowing fairy. Her voice tinkles like a bell made of ice "What are you?"
Even through her eyelids, she sees the flash. "Augh! My eyes!" Bob blinks. The ground rushes at her. 
She watches herself tip slowly towards the huge waiting eyes. The fairy's glow flares brighter, flashing like lightning. Bob's squinting eyes water, but the creature...  It yells. It shakes its head frantically. It stumbles. The ground rushes at Bob.
"I need to get home."
"Do you know how to get there?"  "No! Do you?" "No, but I bet the one-eyed witch does!"  "A one-eyed witch?"
"Cool!"
"Isn't there anyone else we can ask?"
"Don't worry."
The Hut of the One-Eyed Witch! Bob knocks, her hand trembling. The door creaks open. A face peers out, wrinkled as walnut bark, topped with white hair like a dandelion. A grey scarf blindfolds it. "Who's that?" The voice creaks, too. "I'm Bob. I need to get home! Can you help me?" "Human child, eh? You are far from home, oh my, yes! Come in, dearie." Purple flames crackle cozily in the fireplace. Bob perches on a soft, hairy sofa. Alice holds her nose and tries not to touch anything. The Witch feels her way into a rocking chair. It creaks. "There is a door, isn't there? A magic door between our forest and your bedroom, yes, yes!" "Really? Where is it? Please tell me!" "Once I could have, yes, indeed! Once I saw everything, didn't I? Knew many secrets, hm?" "What happened?" "My eye, dearie. My secret-seeing eye. Someone stole it, didn't they? Stole my only eye away and left me blind!" "Ew!" "Not ew, not ew, my pet. A jewel was my eye. A tiny crystal ball, wasn't it? And it's gone!" She blows her nose on her sleeve. 
"That was fun! Do kids always have adventures like this?"  "No! I just woke up here! I want to go home."
"Oh, dearie! Would you do that for an old woman? Bless you, poppet!"
"Maybe I could get it back for you?"
"I guess I'll have to find the door alone."
"But where do I look?" "I bet someone knows where it is. We should ask around. We'll follow the Stone Road - there are always lots of people there."
Alice hops onto Bob's shoulder. "Not alone! I want to know how this story ends!"
"She looks creepy and her hut smells funny, but she's really nice. Come on!"  "Wait! What's your name?" "Name? That's a special word that only belongs to you, right?"  "I guess." "Ooooh, I've always wanted one of those! Can you give me one?" "Perfect! I love it! Now, let's go!"
"Cool!"
"Isn't there anyone else we can ask?"
Alice flits from treetop to treetop, humming. Bob slogs through the underbrush, silent. Her bare feet are sore by the time she spots the hut.
"Yeah!"
Alice flits from treetop to treetop. Bob skips through soft moss, humming the fairy tune. In no time, she spots the hut.
"Great idea!"
"That will never work!"
"Sure it will. Fairies are lucky!"
"I hope you find it, dearies, yes I do! Would you like some milk before you go?" Bob opens her mouth, but Alice is faster: "Thanks, but we need to go right now!" The witch waves from the doorway. Alice whispers "The milk was blue! And I think that's where the smell comes from."
Bob sneaks a peek through the window, yellow with dried grease. Inside, an old woman is chopping herbs with her back to Bob. A cauldron hangs in the fireplace, licked by purple flames. The woman grabs something from a drawer. She lays it on her chopping board. It twitches. It is a tiny dragon! The woman starts to sharpen her knife. Bob pushes the window open.
The door creaks open. A woman's face peers out, wrinkled as walnut bark, topped with white hair like a dandelion.  "Who's that?" The voice creaks, too. "Bob. Where am I?" "Oh, a human child, is it?" She smacks her lips. "You are far from home, oh my, yes! Come in, dearie, come in." Purple flames crackle in the fireplace. Sour-smelling leaves and twisted roots dangle from the ceiling. A bone knife lies on the scarred table. "You must be thirsty, poppet. Let me get you some milk, hmm?" She totters out, humming.  Someone whispers "Help!" "Who said that?" One of the smelly leaves twitches. It is rolled up and tied at both ends with string. "Me! Quick, let me out before the witch gets back!" Bob takes the mug. "Don't do it!" whispers the fairy from inside her shirt. "What was that, dearie?" "Nothing!"
"I'm a fairy! She's going to make stew out of me! Get me out!"
pulls off the string and stuffs the fairy under her shirt.
Inside is a tiny, trembling fairy. "She's going to make stew out of me!"
The old woman's humming approaches. Bob asks her if she's really going to eat the dragon.
The door creaks open. "This dragon says you're going to eat him! Is that true?" The witch smacks her lips. "Oooh yes! I love dragon dumplings. And a kid casserole would hit the spot, too, dearie. Just be a dear and hold still, won't you?" She snatches up the knife and hobbles forwards.
The door creaks open. Bob looks innocent. "Here's your milk, my pet! The milk looks like cream and smells like birthday cake. Bob drinks it.
says "I'm not supposed to take drinks from strangers."
The fairy explodes out of Bob's collar and knocks the mug flying. The spilled milk sizzles and smokes. The witch screeches. "You sneaky snack! Come here, you!" She snatches the knife up and hobbles forward.  The milk has burned a hole in the floor. 
"Me, a stranger? No, no, no! A good friend of your parents, aren't I. Now drink up!" "I'm not allowed!" "Don't be rude, dearie!"
Bob drinks it after all
"I should go."
"A kid!"
"Bob."
"That thing is trying to eat me!"
"Do kidss usually live in trees?"  "No! That thing is trying to eat me!"
She jumps!
She jumps clear. The branches shatter. She sprints through the forest like a deer. The fairy lights her way.
Bob half-jumps, half falls from her branch just before it shatters on the ground. Blinking, she lets the fairy lead her to safety.
She jumps!
"Run!"
Bob drops the mug and runs for the door. The spilled milk sizzles and smokes. The witch screeches and snatches up the knife. "You sneaky snack! Come here, you!"
Bob & the fairy burst through the door. They tear off into the forest. The witch's yells fade into the distance.
"Drink it! Drink it!" The woman presses the mug to Bob's lips.
Bob lifts the mug to her lips.
"A kid!"
"Bob."
There is a pause. Bob watches ants trek through the underbrush. The fairy plays with her toes  The dragon practises swishing its tail. "So, what do you want to do now?"
"Get home!"
"Stop that witch from eating people!"
"Ha! I can help with that! You don't come from the forest, right?" "No, I just woke up here." "That happens sometimes. All kinds of weird creatures just show up." "Weird?" "Uh huh. Never seen one quite like you, though. Anyway, there's a way to get back." "How?" "There is a magic door in the giant's castle. It goes wherever you want it to...." "Great!" " ...but the giant is mean. He won't let you in, and he might try to eat you." "Does everyone here try to eat everyone else?" "The big ones do. Little ones like me keep out of their way." "I guess I have to try to find the giant's door. What are you going to do know." She stares at Bob. "I'm coming with you! I owe you, and anyway, it'll be exciting!" Bob smiles.
"Wow, you're brave! But she'll curse us if we go back to her hut. We're going to need help. We should ask the giant." "Giant?" "He keeps the laws here. If we tell him the witch tried to eat me, he'll put her in jail." "Great!"
"Where is this giant?" "His castle is supposed to be at the end of the Stone Road. But I've never been." "Well, where's the road?" "Come on, I'll show you!"
"That was amazing, but I should go home."
 "Wait! What's your name?" "Name? That's a special word that only belongs to you, right?"  "I guess." "Ooooh, I've always wanted one of those! Can you give me one?" "Perfect! I love it! Now, let's go!"
"Aren't you a little small for a dragon?" "I'm still growing."
"Is that a kind of bush?" "No!" "Ok!"


Bob grabs the fairy and runs!
The witch screeches. "You sneaky snack! Come here, you!"

"Not if I can help it!" A lance of flame pierces the night. Bob jerks her bare feet away from the heat. The huge-eyed hunter also jumps back, but too late: the smell of burnt fur fills the air. "Ow! Ow! I'm sorry, noble dragon! I did not realize that this meat was yours!" Its squeals fade in the distance as it scurries away... leaving Bob treed by the dragon instead! 
Bob yells  "Leave her alone!"
The woman starts and drops her knife. She turns. Her eyes are black and crazy as a pigeon's. Her voice creaks. "And who are you, my pretty?" The fairy stares at both of you, trembling.
pushes the window open silently. The fairy's frantic eyes spot her. Bob puts her finger to her lips. The fairy gives a tiny nod. Bob runs to the front door, pounds on it, then hides behind a tree. The door creaks open. The woman's face peers out, eyes black and crazy like a pigeon's.  "Who's there?" The voice creaks, too. Silence. "Is anyone there?" The fairy zooms out of the window and perches on the roof. "Hmmm... Must have been the wind." She returns to the hut and Bob steps out of hiding. The fairy swoops onto her shoulder.  "Thank y..." From inside the hut comes a furious shriek.  "Run!" The door bursts open. "Come back here, you sneaky snack!" Bob and the fairy tear off into the forest. The woman's yells fade into the distance.  
"You were amazing! You saved my life!"


"Bob."
"None of your business!"
"And I said to leave her alone!" "Who, this dear little fairy? We were just about to have dinner, weren't we? Why don't you join us, poppet?" Behind her back, the fairy shakes her head frantically. Whatever is in the cauldron smells impossibly delicious. Bob's belly rumbles. She pretends to accept so she can free the fairy
says "I'm not supposed to take food from strangers."
"Me, a stranger? No, no, no! A good friend of your parents, aren't I. Come in, come in!" "I'm not allowed!" "Don't be rude, dearie!"
accepts
pretends to accept
Soon, Bob is relaxing on a soft, hairy sofa. The old woman fills a bowl with scrumptious steaming stew. She hands it to Bob. Bob lifts the spoon to her lips. The fairy zooms off the chopping block and knocks the bowl flying. The spilled stew sizzles and smokes. The old woman screeches. "You sneaky snack! Come here, you!" She snatches up the knife.  The stew has burned a hole in the floor.  "Run!"
Soon, Bob is perched on the edge of a hard, hairy sofa. She notices that the fairy's wings are tied together with string. As the old woman bends to fill a bowl with scrumptious steaming stew, Bob grabs the knife and cuts the fairy's wings free.  The witch turns. She screeches. The bowl shatters on the floor. Spilled soup sizzles and smokes. "You sneaky snack! Give it here!" She hobbles towards them, clawing the air with fingernails like talons. The stew has burned a hole in the floor.
They run!
"You saved my life." "Well, you saved mine!"
Bob rests on a tree root, gasping.
"Also my nose - that witch is so smelly. What are you?"
"Run!"
"Please don't eat me!"
lets herself down carefully
"Eat you? I only eat gold and diamonds!"
"Well, you should be! I'm a deadly dragon!"
The firelight glints off its shining scales. Bob realizes that the dragon is no longer than her forearm. "And I just saved your life."
"Aren't you a little small for a dragon?" "I'm still growing."
Wait. Why is there still firelight? The dragon is talking, not spitting fire. Bob coughs as smoke gets in her nose. The trunk of Bob's tree is on fire! 


"Aren't you a little small for a dragon?"
"Thank you."

jumps!
"I'm not afraid of you!"
Just in time: sparks fountain from the trunk into the leaves. The whole tree is burning. "Oops!"
Better to stay calm than to break a leg. She swings from a low branch, landing lightly well away from the oak.

"This could cause a forest fire! We have to put it out!"
"Run!"
"Dragons start fires, we don't stop them!" "We have to do *something*!" They think hard. The tree crackles. "River!" "Who?" "We can ask River. Come on!" The dragon flaps into the darkness. Bob sprints downhill after it, quick as a deer. The ground grows soft and slippery. They step out from under the trees. Moonlight strikes sparks on rushing water. "River! River!" There is a gurgling like a thousand bottles emptying. R: "Do not disturb the water!" "Please, River! The forest needs you! Look!" A jet of water fountains from the river, higher than the treetops. R: "What have you done, you incandescent iguana!" "I'm sorry, really I am. Can you put it out, please?" The current grumbles and sighs over the rocks. R: "I suppose I must. Oh, how I hate to leave my bed." The water overflows its banks, soaking Bob's bare feet. It streams uphill. A moment later, the glow of the burning tree is extinguished. "Problem solved! Let's go or I'll get a lecture." They sneak into the cover of the trees.
Bob sprints through the forest like a deer, the dragon at her heels.



The bushes rustle. A branch snaps.  Something is coming. It is very close now. What is it? It is too dark to tell... until it spits a fountain of fire. A dragon! Luckily, it is only as long as Bob's forearm. "Hi! What are you?"
"A kid!"
"Bob."
"Is that a kind of bush?" "No!" "Ok! So what are you doing here?"
"I just woke up here. I don't know why. I need to get home."

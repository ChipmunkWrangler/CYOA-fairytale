++ Text Choices

 * Offer three choices per node.
 * Different routes to same result, but record the differences ReflectiveChoices and call back to them or have them affect SimulationistNPC
 * Player doesn't know which choices are significant in advance
 * No repeated choices
 * "Force" decisions: one choice is obviously more interesting; nested options (so the eventual destination is the same, but that is not obvious); NPC does stuff that you "needed" to do (plot point becomes character point)
 * Simple decisions that stack remorselessly
 * Reflect state in story (have a murder mystery that uses whatever weapon the character happens to have)
